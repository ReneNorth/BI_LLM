# OpenAI LLM API Python and Power BI Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's LLM (Language Model) API with Python and Power BI. By leveraging the power of OpenAI's LLM, the project aims to enhance natural language processing capabilities and generate insightful language-based visualizations using Power BI.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI LLM API access credentials
- Power BI Desktop

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/openai-llm-powerbi.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

less
Copy code

3. Obtain your OpenAI LLM API credentials. If you don't have them, sign up for access at [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

4. Configure the API credentials in the project. Open the `config.py` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API key.

```python
# OpenAI LLM API credentials
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
Run the Python script to interact with the OpenAI LLM API:
Copy code
python openai_llm_api.py
The script will prompt you to input your desired text or query. The OpenAI LLM API will process the input and generate responses accordingly.

Export the generated responses to a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON) for further analysis and visualization in Power BI.

Open Power BI Desktop and create a new report.

Import the exported data into Power BI and create insightful visualizations using the available Power BI tools and features.

Publish and share the Power BI report with relevant stakeholders to present the analyzed data and derived insights.
